Webium is a Blogger Template or Theme that looks very similar to the Medium.com. [View Demo](https://webium-blogger.blogspot.com/).

The appearance is really very similar. However, there are a few things that need to be improved as this has a huge impact on the accessibility and inconsistent layout on Medium.com.
